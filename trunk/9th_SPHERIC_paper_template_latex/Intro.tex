In these hybrid methods, a fixed or reconstructed every k time steps grid support part of the pressure and velocity calculation. The original idea, given by Monaghan \cite{Mon77} or later works applied to fluid mechanics \cite{Monaghan88} where a pure Lagrangian perspective was used during the whole meshless computation, has been in some cases completed using other well known discretization methods as FVM\cite{Nestor20091733} or FEM\cite{Ide03}. The first combination of Lagrangian methods and FEM methods can be found in\cite{Ide03b}, where a extended Delaunay Tesellation is used to reconstruct the mesh while the fluid evolves. This method, known as MFEM, the construction of the shape functions inside each polyhedron is based on a non-Sibsonian interpolation.

The next step in this evolution was the first version of the PFEM method\cite{Idelsohn04}, which was a robust method designed to solve fluid-structure interaction problems including free-surface, breaking waves, flow separations, etc... where lagrangian particles and meshing processes are alternated with the advantage of having a FEM structure that supports the differential equation solvers. An interesting difference between the PFEM and other particle methods as SPH or MPM\cite{Wieckowsky04} is that while latter methods transport mass and consequently have a volume, PFEM uses non-material points that transport fixed intensive properties of the fluid.

Other methods that also combine both Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives are the arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE)\cite{Donea83} or semi-Lagrangian methods\cite{Bermejo}. The Lagrangian perspective makes possible to use a material derivative formulation where the absence of the non-linear convective terms transform the Navier-Stokes system into a transformed linear coupled problem. Methodologies like the backward Characteristics method\cite{Bermejo} gives also this possibility but if the process is done in a fixed mesh without any distortion, a dissipative process appears due to the interpolation of the feet of characteristics unless high order polynomials are used.

In contrast to the backward characteristic method where the feet of the characteristic line was searched and located in a mesh element based on the known velocity fields at past time steps, a new strategy known as X-IVAS (eXplicit Integration following the Velocity and Acceleration Streamlines) was developed by Idelsohn et al.\cite{Idelsohn12}. This methodology of integrating of convection of fluid particles is based on following the streamlines of the flow in the current time step instead of the particle trajectories, which is a better way to solve the non-linearities of the equations of the flow. Adding this strategy to the original PFEM method, a new methodology called Particle Finite Element Method Second Generation (PFEM-2)\cite{Idelsohn12b} appears. The X-IVAS strategy gives the possibility of solving complex flows with large time steps ($CFL>1$), as well as the presence of the mesh allows accurate solutions of the fractional step method.

In PFEM-2, there are two approaches to communicate particle and mesh data, each one generating two versions of the method. The first one is called \textit{Moving Mesh}, which follows the original idea of PFEM creating a new mesh using the new position of the particles as nodes. The second version, named \textit{Fixed Mesh}, projects states from particles to nodes preserving the initial background mesh. The former strategy keeps the uncomfortable drawback of methods cited before, which is the necessity of constructing or controlling the mesh quality during the simulation if an accuracy of the solution has to be maintained. The evaluation of the mesh distortions or the re-meshing processes are always computationally expensive and it would be interesting exploring the possibility of avoiding that step. Consequently, \textit{Fixed Mesh} approach avoids the remeshing at each time-step. In this approach, mesh nodes and moving particles interchange information through different interpolation algorithms. In the context of this paper, PFEM-2 will refer to the \textit{Fixed Mesh} version, and a detailed explanation of this algorithm is given in Section \ref{PFEM_Algorithm}.

% Most of the methods cited before including PFEM have a uncomfortable drawback which is the necessity of constructing or controlling the mesh quality during the simulation if an accuracy of the solution has to be maintained. The evaluation of the mesh distortions or the re-meshing processes are always computationally expensive and it would be interesting exploring the possibility of avoiding that step. Consequently a new generation of the PFEM methodology could be developed in such a way that no re-meshing is necessary.
% In contrast to the backward characteristic method where the feet of the characteristic line was searched and located in a mesh element based on the known velocity fields at past time steps, a new strategy known as X-IVAS (eXplicit Integration following the Velocity and Acceleration Streamlines) was developed\cite{Idelsohn12}. This methodology uses the streamlines at the present time step instead of the the particle trajectories to convect the fluid particles. The use of this strategy on a fixed mesh and interpolate the particle information to the mesh nodes gives a new improved method known as PFEM-2 \cite{Idelsohn12b}. The use of particles give the possibility of solving complex accurate flows with large time steps ($CFL>1$), while the fixed mesh allows accurate solutions of the fractional step method without any re-meshing process. Mesh nodes and moving particles interchange information using interpolation processes using different strategies. A detailed explanation of the PFEM-2 method is given in Section

In this work the PFEM-2 has been used to solve free-surface flows in different problems starting from classical benchmark problems as the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and finishing with problems of industrial interest. To the authors knowledge, this paper presents the first application to free-surface flows where PFEM-2 advantage of using larger time steps compared to other methods is exploited. This analysis includes very accurately demanding problems as those involving two different fluids with high density ratios. Taking into account that the computational time per time-step is similar as the one required by other methodologies, the possibility of increasing the time-step implies shorter global computational times.
%As in most of the FEM derived methodologies the introduction of a complex geometry is not a problem. 

The treatment of the free-surface has been done simulating both fluids that share the interface and using a scalar function to identify each fluid. To improve the pressure calculation close to the free surface, different versions of the enrichment technique \cite{Coppola05} have been used. The computation of the free-surface at different positions has been compared to other well reputed Eulerian codes obtaining accurate and numerically stable results but using larger time steps. A wide version of free-surface flows has been studied including a wide range of Froude number situations. Although different versions of the enrichment technique are studied in this paper, a novel continuous version of this methodology is presented and can be used in order to avoid the problems generated in high Froude number flows where other versions present poor accuracy.
