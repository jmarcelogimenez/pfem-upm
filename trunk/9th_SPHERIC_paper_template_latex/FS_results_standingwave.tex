\subsection{Viscous standing waves}%Re=250,2500.

Computing the dissipation due to wave-breaking remains a challenging problem in the computational fluid mechanics context. In order to analyze the PFEM-2 solution when two-phase viscous incompressible flows are simulated, the evolution of a viscous standing wave has been chosen. An approximate analytical solution is available for small amplitude perturbations in the scientific literature \cite{Lighthill01} and it is of practical interest since it is related to the propagation of gravity waves.

The chosen standing wave configuration consists in a rectangular tank with length $L$ and a water filling height of $H = L/2$. This setup has been extracted from \cite{Colagrossi12}, for a sketch of this configuration see Figure \ref{fg:standing-wave-config}. The wave length is $\lambda = L$, $k$ is the corresponding wave number (i.e. $k = 2\pi/\lambda$) and $A$ is the wave amplitude that defines the ratio $\epsilon=2A/H$.

When the fluid is viscous, neglecting the wall boundary layer dissipation, and assuming small-amplitude waves (i.e small $\epsilon$) and small wave steepness (i.e $2A/\lambda \ll 0.1$); an approximate analytical solution of the standing wave evolution can be obtained through the linearization of the Navier-Stokes equations for traveling waves:
\begin{align}
 \varphi(x,y,t) & = \varphi_0(x,y)\cos(\omega t) \\
 \varphi_0(x,y) & =-\epsilon\frac{Hg}{2\omega}\frac{\cosh\left[k(y+H)\right]}{\cosh(kH)}\cos(kx)
\end{align}

where the circular frequency $\omega$ is given by the dispersion relation of gravity waves, that is, $\omega^2 = g k \tanh(kH)$ where $g$ is the acceleration of gravity. At time $t = 0$, the free surface is horizontal while the initial fluid velocity is given by $\varphi_0$.

It can be demonstrated that the approximate solution is well posed only for $Re\gg1$ and for $Re^{-1}\ll k \ll Re^{2/3}$, where $Re=H\sqrt{gH}/\nu$ is the Reynolds number for this problem. From that solution, it is possible to obtain the formula that gives the approximate decay of the kinetic energy\cite{Lighthill01}:

\begin{equation}
 \varepsilon_K(t) = \epsilon^2g\frac{\lambda H^2}{32}e^{-4\nu k^2t}\left[1+\cos(2\omega t)\right]
 \label{kin-eq}
\end{equation}

The kinetic attenuation is governed by the parameter $\beta_l = 4\nu k^2$, which depends on the wave number and on the kinematic viscosity $\nu = \mu/\rho_{I}$. Lately, work\cite{Antuono13} has demonstrated that generally, Equation (\ref{kin-eq}) overestimates the dissipations, especially when the Reynolds number is not very large. Then, an improved damping rate was proposed in \cite{Antuono13} $\beta = 4\nu k^2 -  2\sqrt{2}k^{11/4}Re^{-3/2}+O(Re^{-2})$, which is used next for comparisons.

To accomplish the linear solution hypothesis, the PFEM-2 simulations have been implemented using a free-slip condition for the velocity and a Neumann condition for the pressure on each tank boundary. Also, the parameters $L=2$, $A=0.05$ and $g=1$ have been selected.

Several Reynolds number ($Re=25,50,250,2500$) have been chosen to compare with the approximate analytic dissipation. Problems were solved using a grid size $\Delta x$ such that $H/\Delta x=100$ and varying $\Delta t$ in order to solve using a Fourier number $Fo=\frac{\nu\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}$ with a local maximum of $Fo_{max}\approx10-50$. Figure \ref{fg:sw-energy} shows the comparison between the expected energy dissipation (which includes the improved damping rate) and numerical results for the kinetic energy calculated with PFEM-2. Large Fourier numbers were used in order to reduce the computation times required to complete the simulations, showing that the accuracy of the method is maintained with large CFL numbers, even when diffusion is considered.

Regarding the computational effort, it is noticeable that the complete set of PFEM simulations only required a few hours on an Intel i7-2600k 3.4GHz processor. This is a large difference with respect to the CPU times reported in other works, see \cite{Colagrossi12}, where a similar set of problems were solved with similar accuracy using SPH and a 30 CPUs cluster, each CPU with 8 Intel Xeon 2.33GHz cores, running continuously for 30 days.
