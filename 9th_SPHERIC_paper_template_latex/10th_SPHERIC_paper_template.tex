\usepackage{cite}      % Written by Donald Arseneau

                        % result in citation numbers being automatically
                        % sorted and properly "ranged". i.e.,
                        % [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6]
                        % (without using cite.sty)
                        % will become:
                        % [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] (using cite.sty)
                        % cite.sty's \cite will automatically add leading
                        % space, if needed. Use cite.sty's noadjust option
                        % (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this
                        % off. cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX

% NOTE: for dual use with latex and pdflatex, instead load graphicx like:
%\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
%\usepackage{graphicx}
%\else
%\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}

% However, be warned that pdflatex will require graphics to be in PDF
% (not EPS) format and will preclude the use of PostScript based LaTeX
% packages such as psfrag.sty and pstricks.sty. IEEE conferences typically
% allow PDF graphics (and hence pdfLaTeX). However, IEEE journals do not
% (yet) allow image formats other than EPS or TIFF. Therefore, authors of
% journal papers should use traditional LaTeX with EPS graphics.
%
% The path(s) to the graphics files can also be declared: e.g.,
% \graphicspath{{../eps/}{../ps/}}
% if the graphics files are not located in the same directory as the
% .tex file. This can be done in each branch of the conditional above
% (after graphicx is loaded) to handle the EPS and PDF cases separately.
% In this way, full path information will not have to be specified in
% each \includegraphics command.
%
% Note that, when switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the new
% compiler will have to be run twice to clear some warnings.

% Notes on hyperref:
% IEEEtran.cls attempts to be compliant with the hyperref package, written
% by Heiko Oberdiek and Sebastian Rahtz, which provides hyperlinks within
% a document as well as an index for PDF files (produced via pdflatex).
% However, it is a tad difficult to properly interface LaTeX classes and
% packages with this (necessarily) complex and invasive package. It is
% recommended that hyperref not be used for work that is to be submitted
% to the IEEE. Users who wish to use hyperref *must* ensure that their
% hyperref version is 6.72u or later *and* IEEEtran.cls is version 1.6b
% or later. The latest version of hyperref can be obtained at:
%
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref/
%
% Also, be aware that cite.sty (as of version 3.9, 11/2001) and hyperref.sty
% (as of version 6.72t, 2002/07/25) do not work optimally together.
% To mediate the differences between these two packages, IEEEtran.cls, as
% of v1.6b, predefines a command that fools hyperref into thinking that
% the natbib package is being used - causing it not to modify the existing
% citation commands, and allowing cite.sty to operate as normal. However,
% as a result, citation numbers will not be hyperlinked. Another side effect
% of this approach is that the natbib.sty package will not properly load
% under IEEEtran.cls. However, current versions of natbib are not capable
% of compressing and sorting citation numbers in IEEE's style - so this
% should not be an issue. If, for some strange reason, the user wants to
% load natbib.sty under IEEEtran.cls, the following code must be placed
% before natbib.sty can be loaded:
%
% \makeatletter
% \let\NAT@parse\undefined
% \makeatother
%
% Hyperref should be loaded differently depending on whether pdflatex
% or traditional latex is being used:
%
%\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
%\usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[pdftex,hypertexnames=false]{hyperref}
%\fi
%
% Pdflatex produces superior hyperref results and is the recommended
% compiler for such use.



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, a new generation of the particle method known as Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM-2) \cite{Idelsohn04}, which combines convective particle movement and a fixed mesh resolution, is applied to a 2D monophasic flow past a circular cylinder intersecting or close to a free surface at Reynolds 180 \cite{Bouscasse14}. To accomplish this task, different improved versions of discontinuous and continuous enriched basis functions for the pressure field have been developed \cite{Gimenez2015186} to capture the free surface dynamics without artificial diffusion or undesired numerical effects. The well-known numerical properties of PFEM-2 such as using larger time steps when compared to other similar numerical tools which implies shorter computational times while maintaining the accuracy of the computation will be checked in this case. In particular, for this free surface cylinder, the wake behavior for Froude numbers between 0.3 and 2.0 and for gap ratios between -0.5 and 2.5 are examined, see figure 1. The PFEM-2 technique allows for a very little diffusive computation of the free surface evolution, even while breaking and fragmentation may occur. Vorticity shed by the cylinder, vortex generation due to free surface breaking, mixing processes, and drag and lift coefficients behavior are quantified. It has been found that, for small gap ratios, the classical von Karman vortex shedding from the cylinder does not take place for most of the Froude numbers considered. In turn, moderate vortex shedding occurs, departing not from the cylinder but originating from wave breaking at the free surface. This shedding takes places simultaneously with the transport of free surface fluid elements into the bulk of the fluid. In some combinations of Froude number and submergence ratio, a vorticity layer remains spatially localized between the cylinder and the free surface and a large recirculating wake area develops, which eventually gets detached after several shedding cycles, being advected downstream. A secondary stability analysis study is performed using the Froude number as the principal parameter. We are studying if there is any dependance between the Froude number and the transition from a convective to an absolute instability in the cylinder flow. Similarly to the results presented by Dimas \cite{Dimas89} the presence of the free surface has a stabilizing effect at low Froude numbers, suppressing the unsteadiness of the wake. This study is performed using an averaged wake velocity profile obtained with the described PFEM methodology and analyzing the stability of the profile solving a Rayleigh eigenvalue problem and selecting the dominant modes from the computed spectrum.
